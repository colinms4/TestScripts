# Exercise 1.2

# Learning Goals 
Learning about data types in Python
Data Structure for Recipe App

# Question 
Decide what data structure you would use for this purpose, and in your README file in the repository for this task, describe in approx. 50-75 words why youâ€™ve chosen to use it.

I would choose to use a dictionary because of the key and value pairs. A dictionary would be good to store and manipulate data for the recipe app. It helps keep all the data readable and concise and allows for changes.
